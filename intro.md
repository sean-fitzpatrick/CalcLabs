# Jupyter Labs for Lethbridge Calculus

Welcome to the Calculus lab manual for University of Lethbridge.

This book contains some basic details on how to use Python for calculus, 
along with Jupyter notebooks for several lab assignments.

This manual was written by [Sean Fitzpatrick](https://www.cs.uleth.ca/~fitzpat).
Some introductory material, and several labs for Calculus 1, were contributed by Raheem Mir.

**Disclaimer**: Sean is a math instructor with no background in coding.
Many of these notebooks represent his attempts to stumble around the Python documentation until something works,
and do not necessarily represent best coding practice.
