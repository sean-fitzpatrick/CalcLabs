    "# Lab 0: Numpy and Sympy for Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "Two useful packages for doing calculus in Python are Numpy (which allows for numerical computations) and Sympy (which supports symbolic manipulation). These can be used without any prior experience programming in Python (or at all), especially in the Jupyter notebook format, where code snippets can be provided for you to edit and run as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook (such as this one) has two types of content: code cells, which contain Python code, and Markdown cells, which contain text that is formatted using Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "To edit any text in a Jupyter notebook, **double-click on it**. To create a new cell, click the $+$ button in the toolbar above. By default, a new cell is a code cell. To change it to Markdown, use the drop-down menu in the toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "To save (and render) a Markdown cell, or to execute a code cell, either hit `Shift+Enter` on the keyboard, or click the Run button in the toolbar. For help with Markdown formatting, you may find [this markdown cheat-sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) useful. You can type mathematics in a Markdown cell using [LaTeX syntax](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics). To enter mathematics, wrap it in `$` delimiters. For example, `$\\sin(4\\pi/3)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$` produces $\\sin(4\\pi/3)=-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. If we use `$$` delimiters, we get \"display math\" on its own line:\n",
