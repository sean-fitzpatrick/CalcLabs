    "# Calculus 2, Lab 1: Partial Fractions\n",
    "\n",
    "The method of partial fraction decomposition is a useful tool for evaluating integrals of rational functions, and it comes up in other contexts as well, such as the method of Laplace transforms for differential equations. Partial fraction decomposition will also come in handy when you get to sequences and series: a partial fraction decomposition can reveal that a particular series is \"telescoping\": parts of each term cancel with other terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem (which one quickly discovers) is that determining the coefficients for a partial fraction decomposition can be an exercise that is both tedious and error-prone. The brute force method (equating coefficients and solving a system of equations) is not particularly efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it turns out that partial fractions are going to be a part of your life, then you'd like to be able to handle them quickly and accurately. You have two options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let the computer do it for you\n",
    "2. Develop systematic methods (formulas, even!) to get the job done\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll see how the computer implements these methods for us, and you'll have a chance to explore where they come from."
